Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how the body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes: 
type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. More than 133 million Americans are living with diabetes or prediabetes.1 Diabetes occurs when blood glucose, also known as blood sugar, is too high, which is the body's main source of energy. The body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the food we eat.
